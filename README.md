### Ask the user for an input

### Check that the input is a single character




## Milestone 3 - Check if the guessed character is in the word

### Iteratively check if the input is a valid guess

### Check whether the guess is in the word

### Create functions to run the checks


check_guess and ask_for_input functions were created to group block of codes.

The check_guess function will take the guessed letter as an argument and check if the letter is in the word. The function will first convert the guesses word to be in lower case.

The ask_for_input function will iteratively check if the guessed letter exist inside a word. It will also perform nested function as the check_guess function is being called internally.
